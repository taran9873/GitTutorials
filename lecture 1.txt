basic git commands

git init : it initialise a empty git repository in that folder

git status : it tells about staged and unstaged changes in the local system

git log: it lists all the commits and changes made so far

git add "file name" : this will move your file from unstaged region to staged region

git add . : if we want to add all files to staged region we need to write all file names
so... what we do is we just write git add "." and it does the work for us

git commit -m "your msg here" : this is command used to commit files in staged region

git push: used to push a local repo to github

git pull: used to pull a repo from github to local system

git push -u origin master : pushes changes to master branch
