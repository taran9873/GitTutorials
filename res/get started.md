# Ready-get-set-go

check if git is succesfully installed on your system or not

#### search for **git bash** in your start Menu
launch it and terminal will pop up

type following in the terminal
	`git --version`
this will show you the version of git , you have installed on your system

## Now we are ready to rock
i hope you are aware of what git is,if not then GIT is a Version Control System
what i mean by that is , when you use git in a particular folder and initialise git then
it tracks all your files in that folder and , whenever you make any change in any file in
that folder then it tracks that and also allows you to go back to previous changes at any
moment of time
### Real-*GIT*-use 
writing a whole chunk of code for a website or an android app isn't an easy task? is it!!!
**_adding new feature_** is more difficult because what if a particular click doesn't work
or particular button got messed up? then you have to check complete 1000s of line of code and
**_GIT_** enters the room here , we can save our code after writing each function or a particular
activity and git will keep track of that file

## Heard of Open-Source right?
**In real open source, you have the right to control your own destiny.**
— Linus Torvalds
We’ve been using open source software in one way or another and we might not even realize it.
Linux, VLC, Firefox, Android, Wordpress, NodeJS, etc are a few examples. Even the large multinational
companies make use of open source software one way or another.Why should you care? Well, 
imagine that the person who created a specific programming language never had decided to open source it.
Imagine if you had to buy or rent a programming language just to learn how to code. Scary right? Yeah…

### GitHub
it is a platform where we can simply , upload our website or app source code so that others can get 
benefits and Lovely community can contribute and help you identify and solve issues and bugs.and mind it
its a very big community , _well not more than india's population_(Don't get offended)

## Getting Boring right ? lets get right into it

now you have to link your github account to git so that you can upload/push your files on github repo

 `git config --global user.name "Mona Lisa"`
 `git config --global user.password "your password"`
this will link your system GIT to remote/online GitHub

hope you understood everything if not you can ping me `tarandeepsingh.tannu@gmail.com`
